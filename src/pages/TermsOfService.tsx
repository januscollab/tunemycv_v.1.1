            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blueberry dark:text-citrus mt-8 mb-4">6. Payment Terms and Billing</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blueberry dark:text-citrus mt-6 mb-3">Service Pricing and Fees</h3>
            <p>
              TuneMyCV operates on a fee-for-service model, with pricing clearly displayed on our website for each service offering. All prices are quoted in the currency specified on our platform and are subject to change without prior notice. However, any price changes will not affect services that have already been purchased and are in progress.
            </p>
            <p>
              Service fees are determined based on factors including the complexity of the service, the level of expertise required, the turnaround time requested, and any additional features or consultations included in the package. Premium services, rush delivery options, and specialized industry expertise may incur additional charges.
            </p>
            <p>
              All fees are exclusive of applicable taxes, duties, or other governmental charges, which will be added to your invoice as required by law. You are responsible for paying all applicable taxes associated with your purchase of our services.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blueberry dark:text-citrus mt-6 mb-3">Payment Processing and Methods</h3>
            <p>
              Payment for TuneMyCV services must be made in full before service delivery begins, except where specific payment plan arrangements have been made and agreed upon in writing. We accept various payment methods, including major credit cards, debit cards, and electronic payment systems such as PayPal.
            </p>
            <p>
              All payments are processed through secure, encrypted payment gateways that comply with industry standards for financial data protection. TuneMyCV does not store your complete payment information on our servers, relying instead on trusted third-party payment processors to handle sensitive financial data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Payment confirmation will be sent to your registered email address upon successful processing. This confirmation serves as your receipt and should be retained for your records.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blueberry dark:text-citrus mt-6 mb-3">Payment Plans and Installments</h3>
            <p>
              For certain high-value services, TuneMyCV may offer payment plan options that allow you to spread the cost over multiple installments. Payment plans are subject to approval and may require additional verification or documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              When participating in a payment plan, you agree to make all scheduled payments on time according to the agreed-upon schedule. Failure to make timely payments may result in suspension of services, additional fees, or termination of the service agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Payment plan terms, including the number of installments, payment amounts, and due dates, will be clearly specified in a separate payment agreement that supplements these Terms.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blueberry dark:text-citrus mt-6 mb-3">Refund and Cancellation Policy</h3>
            <p>
              TuneMyCV offers a structured refund policy designed to balance customer satisfaction with the realities of providing personalized professional services. The specific terms of our refund policy depend on the stage of service delivery and the nature of the service purchased.
            </p>
            <p>
              For services that have not yet begun, meaning no consultation has occurred and no work has been performed, you may request a full refund within 48 hours of purchase. This cooling-off period allows you to reconsider your decision without penalty.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once service delivery has commenced, including initial consultations or the beginning of document creation, refunds become subject to different terms. If you are unsatisfied with the first draft of your document, you may request a 50% refund within 14 days of receiving the initial draft, provided you have participated in the revision process in good faith.
            </p>
            <p>
              No refunds will be provided after you have approved the final deliverables or after 30 days from the completion of services, whichever occurs first. This policy recognizes that our services involve significant time investment and personalized attention from our professional staff.
            </p>
            <p>
              Refunds for services involving multiple components, such as packages that include both CV writing and coaching sessions, will be calculated on a pro-rata basis for completed versus uncompleted elements.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blueberry dark:text-citrus mt-6 mb-3">Billing Disputes and Resolution</h3>
            <p>
              If you believe there has been an error in billing or if you wish to dispute a charge, you must contact our customer service team within 30 days of the charge appearing on your statement. We will investigate all billing disputes promptly and work with you to resolve any legitimate issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the dispute resolution process, you remain responsible for paying any undisputed portions of your bill. If a billing error is confirmed, we will promptly issue appropriate credits or refunds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chargebacks initiated without first attempting to resolve the issue directly with TuneMyCV may result in suspension of services and additional administrative fees to cover processing costs.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blueberry dark:text-citrus mt-8 mb-4">7. Service Delivery and Turnaround Times</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blueberry dark:text-citrus mt-6 mb-3">Standard Delivery Timeframes</h3>
            <p>
              TuneMyCV is committed to delivering high-quality services within reasonable timeframes that balance thoroughness with efficiency. Standard turnaround times vary depending on the complexity and scope of the requested service, with most basic CV writing services completed within 5-7 business days from the receipt of all required information and payment confirmation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Comprehensive packages that include multiple documents, such as CV, cover letter, and LinkedIn profile optimization, typically require 7-10 business days for completion. Executive-level services and highly specialized industry-specific documents may require additional time due to the enhanced research and customization involved.
            </p>
            <p>
              Turnaround times are calculated from the point when all necessary information has been received, payment has been processed, and any required initial consultations have been completed. Delays in providing requested information or participating in scheduled consultations will extend the delivery timeline accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
              All turnaround time estimates are provided on a "best efforts" basis and represent our standard service levels achieved in the majority of cases. While we strive to meet these timeframes consistently, they are not guaranteed delivery dates, and various factors may occasionally cause delays.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blueberry dark:text-citrus mt-6 mb-3">Expedited Service Options</h3>
            <p>
              For clients with urgent deadlines, TuneMyCV offers expedited service options that prioritize your project for faster completion. Rush delivery services are available for most offerings, typically reducing standard turnaround times by 50% or more, subject to current workload and writer availability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Expedited services incur additional fees that reflect the priority handling and potential overtime work required to meet accelerated deadlines. These fees are clearly disclosed at the time of service selection and must be paid in addition to standard service charges.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rush service availability is subject to current capacity and cannot always be guaranteed, particularly during peak periods or for highly specialized services. We recommend contacting our customer service team to confirm availability before selecting expedited options.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blueberry dark:text-citrus mt-6 mb-3">Factors Affecting Delivery Times</h3>
            <p>
              Several factors may influence the actual delivery time for your service, and understanding these can help set appropriate expectations. The complexity of your career history, including multiple career changes, gaps in employment, or highly technical roles, may require additional time for proper presentation and optimization.
            </p>
            <p>
              The level of customization requested, such as targeting specific industries or roles, requires additional research and tailoring that extends the standard timeline. Similarly, requests for multiple format versions or specialized layouts may add to the completion time.
            </p>
            <p>
              External factors such as holidays, peak demand periods, or unforeseen circumstances affecting our writers may also impact delivery schedules. During such periods, we will communicate any potential delays as early as possible and work to minimize their impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your responsiveness to requests for information, feedback, or clarification directly affects the timeline. Prompt responses enable our writers to maintain momentum, while delays in communication necessarily extend the overall completion time.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blueberry dark:text-citrus mt-6 mb-3">Communication During Service Delivery</h3>
            <p>
              Throughout the service delivery process, TuneMyCV maintains regular communication to keep you informed of progress and to address any questions or concerns that may arise. You will receive confirmation when your project begins, updates at key milestones, and notification when drafts are ready for review.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our project management system ensures that you are assigned a dedicated writer or consultant who serves as your primary point of contact throughout the process. This individual is responsible for understanding your specific needs and ensuring that the final deliverables meet your expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
              If circumstances arise that may affect your delivery timeline, we will notify you as soon as possible and work with you to find acceptable solutions. This may include adjusting deadlines, modifying service scope, or providing interim deliverables to meet urgent needs.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blueberry dark:text-citrus mt-8 mb-4">8. Revision and Amendment Process</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blueberry dark:text-citrus mt-6 mb-3">Included Revision Rounds</h3>
            <p>
              TuneMyCV recognizes that creating the perfect CV often requires refinement and adjustment based on your feedback and evolving needs. Our standard service packages include a specified number of revision rounds designed to ensure your complete satisfaction with the final deliverables.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most basic services include two rounds of revisions following the delivery of the initial draft. This allows for substantial modifications based on your feedback while maintaining reasonable project timelines and resource allocation. Premium and executive-level services may include additional revision rounds commensurate with their enhanced scope and pricing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each revision round provides an opportunity to request changes to content, formatting, emphasis, or structure based on your review of the previous draft. We encourage detailed, specific feedback that enables our writers to make targeted improvements that align with your vision and objectives.
            </p>
            <p>
              The revision process is collaborative, with our writers providing professional guidance on the feasibility and advisability of requested changes. While we strive to accommodate all reasonable requests, we may provide alternative suggestions when proposed changes could negatively impact the document's effectiveness.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blueberry dark:text-citrus mt-6 mb-3">Revision Timeline and Process</h3>
            <p>
              Upon receiving each draft, you have a specified period, typically 7 business days, to review the document and provide feedback for revisions. This timeframe ensures adequate time for thorough review while maintaining project momentum and enabling timely completion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Revision requests must be submitted in writing, preferably through our designated communication channels, with specific details about desired changes. Vague or unclear feedback may result in revisions that do not meet your expectations, potentially requiring additional rounds of refinement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our writers will acknowledge receipt of your revision requests and provide an estimated timeline for completion of the revised draft. Most revisions are completed within 2-3 business days, depending on the extent of changes requested and current workload.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you fail to provide revision feedback within the specified timeframe, the current draft may be considered approved, and the project may be marked as complete. Extensions to the review period may be granted in exceptional circumstances but must be requested before the original deadline expires.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blueberry dark:text-citrus mt-6 mb-3">Scope of Revisions</h3>
            <p>
              Revisions are intended to refine and improve the existing document based on the original service scope and information provided. Substantial additions of new information, such as additional work experience, education, or skills not previously disclosed, may be considered beyond the scope of standard revisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Changes that fundamentally alter the document's structure, target audience, or strategic approach may require additional consultation and could incur supplementary charges. Our writers will advise you if requested changes fall outside the scope of included revisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Formatting and layout adjustments, content reorganization, and language refinements are typically included within standard revision rounds. However, requests for completely different design templates or radical restructuring may require additional time and resources.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blueberry dark:text-citrus mt-6 mb-3">Additional Revisions and Fees</h3>
            <p>
              If you require revisions beyond those included in your service package, additional revision rounds are available for a supplementary fee. These fees are designed to cover the additional time and expertise required while remaining reasonable and transparent.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cost of additional revisions varies depending on the extent of changes requested and the complexity of implementation. Minor adjustments may incur minimal fees, while substantial rewrites or major structural changes may require more significant investment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before proceeding with additional revisions that incur fees, we will provide a clear estimate of the costs involved and obtain your explicit approval. No additional charges will be applied without your prior consent and understanding of the associated costs.
            </p>

            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blueberry dark:text-citrus mt-6 mb-3">Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
            <p>
              Personal data is retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, comply with legal obligations, and resolve any disputes that may arise.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blueberry dark:text-citrus mt-6 mb-3">No Guarantee of Employment Outcomes</h3>
            <p>
              TuneMyCV provides professional CV writing, optimization, and career consultation services designed to improve your professional presentation and enhance your competitiveness in the job market. However, we want to be absolutely clear that our services do not guarantee employment, job interviews, job offers, salary increases, promotions, or any other specific career outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The success of your job search depends on numerous factors beyond the quality of your CV or resume, including but not limited to your qualifications, experience, skills, interview performance, market conditions, industry trends, economic factors, employer preferences, competition from other candidates, networking efforts, and timing of applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              While our services are designed to significantly improve your professional presentation and increase your chances of success, we cannot control or influence the hiring decisions of potential employers. Each employer has unique requirements, preferences, and selection criteria that may vary significantly across organizations and positions.
            </p>
            <p>
              You acknowledge and agree that you are ultimately responsible for the outcome of your job search and career advancement efforts. A professionally written CV is just one component of a successful job search strategy, and additional efforts such as networking, skill development, interview preparation, and strategic job targeting are typically necessary for optimal results.
            </p>

              However, we make no warranties or representations, express or implied, regarding the effectiveness, accuracy, or suitability of the documents or advice we provide for your specific situation or career objectives. The subjective nature of hiring decisions means that what appeals to one employer may not appeal to another.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our services are based on current industry best practices, market research, and professional expertise, but the rapidly evolving nature of the job market means that strategies and approaches that are effective today may become less effective in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              We strive to stay current with industry trends, employer preferences, and best practices, but we cannot guarantee that our approaches will remain optimal for all situations or that they will be universally accepted by all employers or industries.
